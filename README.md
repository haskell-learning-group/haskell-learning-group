# What's this?
We offer a Haskell mentoring program for everyone.

When you join a group, we ask you for your skill level and preferences and assign an appropriate mentor. Mentor will track your progress, assign tasks/material to read and help out.

After some period, we expect you to gain enough skills so you won't need a mentor anymore. Indeed, we expect you to start helping people out in general channels and become a mentor yourself eventually, but that's pretty optional.

# How can I join?
Just ping Alexey Shmalko at <rasen.dubi@gmail.com> or Konstiantyn Rybnikov at <k-bx@k-bx.com> with your email and we'll add you to slack.

## I haven't programmed before, will you onboard me?
Sure. Actually, Haskell is like relearning programming from the start, so you'll be on almost the same level as others.

# I want to be a mentor, what should I do?
Ping Alexey or Kostya and we'll discuss that.

## I'm not sure I'll be a good mentor but want to try
It's OK, we'll assign you with other mentors in a pair, so they can help you.

# Can I join if I don't want to be part of mentoring?
Yeah, sure. Everyone is free to hang out at general channels, ask/answer questions etc.

# Other questions
## Why are you doing this?
We're in love with Haskell and want to share this love with other people.

## What languages are supported?
We have mentors who are native speakers of Russian/Ukrainian/English/Dutch, so these languages are currently supported.

## What are future plans?
After getting enough mentors and skilled students we hope to start working on training projects in groups, and some real ones eventually.

## I still have a question, how can I ask it?
Ask Alexey Shmalko at <rasen.dubi@gmail.com> or Konstiantyn Rybnikov at <k-bx@k-bx.com> or ask question in #general at slack.
